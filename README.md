  ## Installation:
  Once you have downloaded the correct repository, you are going to want to download to right dependencies, which include: inquirer, and mysql2. Now inside of the terminal window you are going to want to cd into the correct repo, once inside you are going to run the code: mysql -u root -p, you will be prompted for your password. Then run the code: SOURCE schema.sql and SOURCE seed.sql, these two codes will allow you to work with the companies data provided to work the command line application. Now you can quit the mysql CLI by typing quit, you should be back in the repo folder that you downloaded and we can now run the command: node index.js to start the prompts for the user/administrator to populate their database of employee information.
